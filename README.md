Threat Hunt Notes and Resources

MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. 
https://attack.mitre.org/

The RE&CT Framework is designed for accumulating, describing and categorizing actionable Incident Response techniques.
RE&CT's philosophy is based on the MITRE's ATT&CK framework.
https://atc-project.github.io/atc-react/

The main use cases are:
Prioritization of Incident Response capabilities development, including skills development, technical measures acquisition/deployment, internal procedures development, etc
Gap analysis — determine "coverage" of existing Incident Response capabilities

Main resources:

RE&CT Navigator (modified ATT&CK Navigator) for visualization and observing the big picture
https://atc-project.github.io/react-navigator/

Automatically generated RE&CT website is the best place for getting details about existing analytics
